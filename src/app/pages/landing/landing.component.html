      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cultivate a growth mindset.</strong> Whenever something impacts us, either through circumstances, thoughts
          or feelings, we can either make a choice, or react.
          <br>When we make a choice, we ask questions like: "What do I want? What can I learn?", which usually move us forward.
          <br>When we react, we ask questions like: "Whose fault is it? What's wrong with me?", which usually get us stuck.
        </li>
         <li><strong>Consciously create the world of your choosing.</strong> Using questions as a powerful tool to adjust direction
          can really impact your life in a positive way.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Reflect and find clarity</strong>. Take the time to get clear on what matters to you, or just express appreciation
          for life through writing.
        </li>
